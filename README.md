Quickstart:

*Note: MongoDB must be runnig.

I spent some time learning Symfony and tried to set up MongoDB-ReactJS-Symfony but couldn't due to configuration issues. Since there wasn't much time I decided to use Hashnode's mern-starter. 
I spent around 5 hours for Symfony learning and setup. For this prototype (with mern-starter) I spent between 4 to 5 hours in total. I would have loved to write all from scratch but I couldn't risk. Overall I am satisfied with this working prototype. Although, UI would need impovement. I did simple conditional rendering but navigation would be better with react-router. Better state management and error handling would be improvement as well. Application doesn't check input content at the moment. I tried to deploy it to Heroku but something was wrong with MLab mongodb url for authentication.
